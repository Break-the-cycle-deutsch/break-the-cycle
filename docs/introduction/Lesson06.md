![](http://sfhelp.org/art/colorbutton.gif)** Introduction**

**Premise: **families exist to _nurture _\- i.e. to fill their members' [basic needs.](http://sfhelp.org/relate/pop/maslow.htm)  Depending on many factors, families (like yours) range from low-nurturance to high-nurturance. This Lesson uses the ideas in the prior five Lessons to propose how to (a) nurture the young people in your family effectively, and to (b) help protect your descendents from inheriting the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm) 

**This Lesson **is meant to augment well-researched parenting programs like these:

> **Parent** Effectiveness Training (PET), by Dr. Thomas Gordon
> 
> **Support **and Training for Emancipated Parents (STEP)
> 
> **The** Active Parenting program, by Dr. Michael H. Popkin

This online Lesson includes vital concepts that such parenting programs usually omit:

* a [family-systems](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/systems.htm)vs. child-focused approach to effective parenting
    
* the toxic effects of parents' inherited psychological [wounds](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/wounds.htm) (Lesson 1)
    
* the unseen, lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm) that passes down the generations.
    
* principles of effective thinking and communication (Lesson 2),
    
* the importance of evolving and using a healthy family [grieving policy](http://sfhelp.org/grief/pop/policy.htm)(Lesson 3)
    
* how to analyze and resolve most relationship problems (Lesson 4)
    
* traits of a high-nurturance family and family tree (Lesson 5)
    
* typical special needs of minor kids of parental death or divorce, and perspective on "Parent Alienation Syndrome" (PAS), and...
    
* [Quizzes](http://sfhelp.org/site/pop/quizzes.htm)to help parents assess their awareness of these topics.
    

Typical stepkids have special needs. Effective stepfamily co-parenting builds on Lessons 1 thru 6, and is outlined in Lesson 7.

 **This Lesson **assumes you're familiar with...  
 

* the [intro](http://sfhelp.org/site/intro.htm) to this nonprofit Web site and the [premises](http://sfhelp.org/site/premises.htm) underlying it   
    
* self-improvement [Lessons 1 thru 5](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)  
     
    

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/colorbutton.gif) **How to Benefit from This Lesson**

The best time to study these is before you have or adopt a child. Quality nurturing during a child's first 4 to 6 years will minimize problems later on! These Lesson-6 "assignments" are like a college course, and should take you several weeks to do, so adopt a patient long-range view and the open mind of a student.

Accept that you won't know how effective your family adults are at parenting until each child leaves home to live independently and perhaps raise their own kids. Pace yourselves, and learn a little at a time. Seek basic principles, not rifle-shot solutions to parenting problems.

Don't expect much benefit from these parenting assignments unless each of your primary parents and supporters is guided by her or his [true Self.](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/Selftraits.htm) _If they're not, focus your energy on [Lesson 1](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/lesson1.htm)here._

Use this sixth Break-the-Cycle Lesson as a flexible framework, and adapt it to fit your unique family situation. The assignments below build on each other, so do them in order. The more you study, the clearer all the ideas will become.

Options...

* print some or most articles and worksheets to refer to as you go
    
* keep a notebook or journal to capture your reactions and validate your progress;
    
* include resources in this Lesson in any family meetings;
    
* alert other parents and any professionals supporting your family (e.g. counselors, teachers, clergy, etc.) to this [course](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)and/or Lesson;  
    
* use this Lesson in any parenting-support group you participate in.
    

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/colorbutton.gif)**  LESSON 6 - Learn to ****Parent (Nurture) Effectively**

This lesson plan has three parts:

> 1) Basics for child-caregivers in all families and organizations;
> 
> 2) Managing common parenting problems effectively, and...
> 
> 3) Parenting if your family is divorcing or divorced

These assignments aim to raise your awareness of _effective_ parenting, rather than decree absolute right/wrong ideas. Check off each assignment as you complete it, and hilight any you feel are specially useful. Ideally, study this Lesson with other family adults and supporters. Coach yourself as you learn: _"Progress, not perfection!"

**Part 1 - Effective-parenting Basics for All Caregivers**

**__** **6-1) Set** the stage by scanning these brief selected [research/news items](http://sfhelp.org/site/research.htm#L5%20&%206%20-%20families%20&%20parenting) about parenting and family life. Notice your thoughts and feelings as you do.

**__** **6-2) Get** quiet and undistracted, and take the first six of these [quizzes](http://sfhelp.org/site/pop/quizzes.htm)without rushing. If you have trouble answering any items, study the appropriate Lesson before working on this one.

**__ 6-3)  ![](http://sfhelp.org/art/starbullet.gif) _ Review** the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/fam/cycle.htm) that causes - and is caused by - ineffective parenting + social denial and indifference.** _ **Try describing the cycle to someone to see if you understand it.

**__ 6-4) See** if you agree with these ideas about [_effective_ parenting.](http://sfhelp.org/parent/parent.htm)_Effective parenting is essential to protect your descendents from the cycle's toxic __[effects!](http://sfhelp.org/pop/effects.htm)_

**__** **6-6)** **Study** this [overview](http://sfhelp.org/fam/health.htm) of high-nurturance ("functional") family systems. Was your birth family "functional"? What's your family's nurturance level recently? (low > moderate > high). What would improve that?

**__** **6-7) Consider** these ideas about [qualified](http://sfhelp.org/parent/conceive.htm)[child conception](http://sfhelp.org/parent/conceive.htm) or acquisition.How can you tell if a family is _ready_ to nurture a child  successfully? Do you know any families who weren't ready?

**__ 6-13) Reflect** on Dr. Abraham Maslow's ideas about [how normal human needs rank](http://sfhelp.org/relate/keys/maslow.htm). Do you agree with his ideas? How is each of your kids doing with this "hierarchy of needs?" How are each of your family _adults_ doing, starting with _you_? Note \- typical kids of parental death and separation also have a mix of concurrent _adjustment_ needs (#49 below).

**__ 6-14) Review** this video on three widespread types of [early-childhood trauma](http://youtu.be/Zo1RBWNT5Ts "A YouTube clip on early-childhood trauma"). Have they affected members of your family?

Now you're prepared to study other useful courses on effective parenting like these (different Web sites):

* [Parent Effectiveness Training (PET) class](http://www.gordontraining.com/parentingclass.html)\* by Dr. Thomas Gordon; and/or...
    
* [Support and Training for Exceptional Parents (STEP)](http://tnstep.org/),\* and/or...
    
* The [Active Parenting program](http://www.activeparenting.com/category/Parenting)\* by Dr. Michael H. Popkin
    

> Option \- search the Web for "effective parenting."

**Notice** what you're thinking and feeling as you finish this Lesson. Is their something you want to _do _now with what you've learned? Would the other adults in your family (and community) be able to pass these [quizzes?](http://sfhelp.org/site/pop/quizzes.htm)Would the teachers in your schools? if not - _why_ not?

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/colorbutton.gif) **Recap**

**This sixth self-improvement Lesson** proposes basic information that average adults need in order to raise a child successfully over two decades. Putting this information into practice requires typical adults to have (a) [freed their true Self](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/freeSelf.htm)to guide them through the decades (Lesson 1), and to have (b) integrated the key ideas in each of the [five prior lessons.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)

Premise \- Most adults are [Grown Wounded Children](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/gwc.htm)(GWCs) because their parents and other caregivers (including grandparents and teachers) were unable to meet these two requisites. Unaware citizens and governments accept this, though it is inexorably weakening many (most?) cultures and our environment.

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/arro-rt2.gif)**If you're interested in** growing and enjoying a high-nurturance stepfamily, continue with **[Lesson 7](http://sfhelp.org/sf/guide7.htm)**. If you're motivated to tell others about what you learned here, see these [practical options](http://sfhelp.org/alert.htm).
