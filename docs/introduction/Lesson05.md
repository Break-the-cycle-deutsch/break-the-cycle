**This is one of a series** of articles on evolving and enjoying [high-nurturance](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/nurture.htm) families (Lesson 5). The series exists because the wide range of current U.S. social [problems](http://sfhelp.org/pop/effects.htm) suggests that most families don't nurture their members very well. _That_ suggests the epidemic effects of the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)proposed in this nonprofit, ad-free site .

# LESSON 5 - evolve a high-nurturance family**

Families exist to _nurture _\- i.e. to fill their members' [basic needs.](http://sfhelp.org/relate/pop/maslow.htm) Depending on many factors, families (like yours) range from low-nurturance (dysfunctional) to high-nurturance (functional). This lesson proposes how to significantly raise the nurturance-level of your family and help [break](http://sfhelp.org/pop/btc.htm)the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] cycle. 

You'll get the most from this self-improvement lesson if you make significant progress on the prior [four lessons.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)This Lesson pertains to all types of families. Lesson 7 extends this one to focus on high-nurturance [stepfamilies.](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/full_sf.htm)Effective_ parenting_ merits its own Lesson (6). Option \- check off each assignment after you complete it to track your progress.

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/starbullet.gif)  **Objective** \- learn how families "function," so you can assess and improve your family's nurturance level, and avoid passing on the \[wounds + unawareness\] cycle to your descendants.

 Option \- keep a journal or log as you study these assignments to note your reactions and discoveries. Your log can provide a source of helpful awareness in the future.

# Recap

This is the study guide for Lesson 5 of 7 - evolve a high-nurturance family. It provides basic information about family systems, structure, and dynamics that many adults don't know. The lesson starts and ends with a quiz to gauge how much you think you know about these vital family basics. This study guide ends with an array of practical ways you can use the ideas in online lessons 1 thru 5.

The next two lessons build on this one - **Lesson 6** proposes keys to effective parenting, and **Lesson 7** outlines options for evolving a high-nurturance stepfamily.
