This unique course is based on my 36 years' research and experience as a family-systems and trauma-recovery therapist, blended with the wisdom of scores of wise teachers and clinicians. The course integrates theories on personalities + communication + grief + relationships + families + parenting. In working with well over 1,000 average women and men in my therapy practice and classes, I have never met one adult who had integrated these topics into an effective lifestyle. Nor have I seen any course like this one.

# Lesson Outlines

The title links below will take you to each lesson. 

## [LESSON 1)](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/guide1.htm)  WOUND HEALING
A high majority of average women and men are unaware of carrying up to six specific psychological [wounds](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/wounds.htm)from early-childhood abandonment, neglect, and abuse (trauma). This Lesson shows you how to assess for such wounds and reduce them by freeing your true Self to guide you. 

This keystone Lesson has four parts, following an introductory overview of addictions:

* Learn about personality subselves and Grown Wounded Children (GWCs);
    
* Assess yourself for up to six psychological wounds;
    
* Evolve and work an effective plan to free your true Self from false-self dominance and reduce your wounds; and...
    
* Learn how to spot and relate to other wounded people
    

## [LESSON 2)](http://sfhelp.org/cx/guide2.htm)  EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION
Effective communication and thinking is _essential_ for all relationships, families, and organizations - yet our ancestors and schools don't teach these basics and seven skills. Test your knowledge by taking this [quiz](http://sfhelp.org/cx/quiz2.htm). This lesson has four parts:

* Basic concepts - what you need to know about communicating;.
    
* Seven powerful skills. If you can't name and describe the skills, you're not using them.
    
* Useful communication tools and resources, and...
    
* Key relationship applications of these basics, skills, and tools..
    

To sample Lesson-2 topics, see these YouTube [videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB607BA268DCAFD5D&feature=mh_lolz "YouTube playlist 2a"). They're meant to augment, not replace, the lesson study guide.

## [LESSON 3)](http://sfhelp.org/grief/guide3.htm) LEARN TO DO "GOOD GRIEF"
We all have _losses_ (broken bonds) throughout our lives. _Unawareness_ and [ignorance](http://sfhelp.org/grief/quiz3.htm "A quiz about heathy-grieving basics") of healthy mourning  promotes incomplete grief. _That_ promotes significant psychological and physical problems like "depression," addictions, obesity, and diabetes. These four parts  show you how to spot and finish incomplete grief, and grow a "pro-grief" family.

* Basics - what you and your kids need to know about bonding, losses, and healthy grief;
* Assess yourself or others for incomplete grief.
* Complete any unfinished grief, and form healthy new bonds.
* Learn to support other grievers effectively

To sample Lesson-3 topics, see these YouTube [video clips](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F5CA64DA3A851E1&feature=mh_lolz "The Lesson-3 YouTube video playlist").

## [LESSON 4)](http://sfhelp.org/relate/guide4.htm)  OPTIMIZE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS 
The thriving counseling and therapy industry exists partly because millions of people"can't get along with" (relate to) each other. The primary reasons for this are widespread psychological wounds + ignorance of Lessons 1 thru 4.

This Lesson provides effective-relationship basics and how to apply them to relationships with your subselves (inner family); Higher Power; your family members, and other adults and kids. To learn what you need to learn about relationships, try this [quiz](http://sfhelp.org/relate/quiz4.htm).

Lesson 4 has five sequential parts.

* relationship basics
* relating to yourself,
* how to solve relationship problems
* primary relationships, divorce, and ex-mate relations; and...
* relating effectively to a Higher Power.

## [LESSON 5)](http://sfhelp.org/fam/guide5.htm)  IMPROVE YOUR FAMILY'S FUNCTIONING
The wide range of personal and social [problems](http://sfhelp.org/pop/effects.htm)suggests that the current family norm is dysfunction. Use Lessons 1-4 to understand the ingredients of a **high-nurturance ("functional") family**. Then assess the [nurturance level](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/nurture.htm)of your childhood and current families, and improve the current level as needed.

To learn what you need to learn about families, take t6his quizLesson-5 parts are:

* Basic concepts you need to know about all families (like yours)
    
* Traits of a high-nurturance ("functional") family
    
* Identify and resolve typical "family problems" using knowledge and skills from Lessons 1 thru 4
    

To sample Lesson-5 topics, see these brief YouTube [videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/gercacn#grid/user/36F79F0157760094 "The Lesson-5 YouTube video playlist").

## [LESSON 6)](http://sfhelp.org/parent/guide6.htm)  EFFECTIVE PARENTING
Unseen psychological wounds are epidemic because of widespread early-childhood abandonment, abuse, and neglect (trauma). This Lesson outlines the developmental and special needs of kids and teens, and how to fill those needs (to nurture) _effectively_. _Without major progress at Lessons 1-6, psychologically-wounded adults  (GWCs) risk unintentionally passing their inherited injuries and unawareness on _[to their kids.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)

Lesson-6 covers:

* Normal developmental needs of typical minor kids,
* Effective-parenting basics, including...
    * traits of effective parents
    * communicating effectively with children and teens, and...
    * guidelines for effective child discipline.
        

Most of these ideas apply to effective grandparenting.

To sample Lesson-6 topics, study these YouTube [videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1AA3406C3AB625CF&feature=mh_lolz "The Lesson-6 YouTube video playlist").

## [LESSON 7](http://sfhelp.org/sf/guide7.htm))  STEPFAMILIES
Because divorce is so prevalent, millions of [stepfamilies](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/nuc_sf.htm)exist. Sociologists estimate that typical U.S. stepfamily re/marriages fail <ins>more often</ins> than first-marriage families. From 36 years' study and counseling over 1,000 stepfamily adults, this Lesson provides stepfamily basics, and applies Lessons 1 thru 6 toward growing a stable, high-nurturance re/marriage and stepfamily. Sequential parts include...

* Learn stepfamily basics, myths, and realities;
* Essential courtship education - make three informed choices to avoid probable re/divorce;
* Stepkids' special needs, and effective co-parenting (stepparenting and bioparenting); and...
* Avoid or resolve common stepfamily role and relationship problems.

alert other people to the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)and its [effects](http://sfhelp.org/pop/effects.htm)and encourage them to end it. 

Options:
* Use your awareness and knowledge from this course to build a high-nurturance family and protect your descendents from the \[wounds + unawareness\] cycle. As you do...
* Alert other people to the cycle and its effects, and their options for breaking it.
    

## [human-service professionals](http://sfhelp.org/pro/pop/professions.htm)
The last section of this Web site** is under construction. It will be a free online course for [human-service professionals](http://sfhelp.org/pro/pop/professions.htm) based on the 7 lessons above. I believe that most professionals on all levels are partially unaware of these topics. Many are psychologically wounded and don't know it., which degrades the effectiveness of their work and their health.

This self-improvement course will propose how human-service professionals can use their training and skills to help troubled persons, couples, and families...

* reduce their wounds and [free](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/freeSelf.htm)their true Self to guide them,
* increase their [awareness and knowledge,](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/aware.htm)
* function better, and
* protect their kids from inheriting this lethal [cycle.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)
