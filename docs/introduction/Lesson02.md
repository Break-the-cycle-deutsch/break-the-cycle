# Why Study This Lesson?

Every day, all adults and kids strive to reduce personal and social discomforts - i.e. to fill current needs. "Happiness" and "peace" is an illusive state where our key needs are met well enough at the moment. The most powerful skills you can learn to fill your daily needs are _effective thinking and communication. "_Thinking_"_ is _internal_communicationamong your [personality subselves](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/personality.htm)(Lesson 1).

I'm a professional communicator. I've studied this subject for over 40 years. My experience as a therapist, teacher, and a student of human behavior is that regardless of schooling, _average adults (like you?) have never studied effective communication, and don't know what they need to know about it_. They (you?) are content (or not) with ineffective thinking and communicating.

Western culture pays little attention to effective interpersonal communication  For example: I had to ask the editors of About.com and AllExperts.com to include "communication" in their extensive list of educational topics for their site visitors.

Over 80% of site visitors who respond to this **[poll](http://sfhelp.org/cx/pop/poll_cx_ntrst.htm)**say they are "extremely interested" in learning to communicate more effectively. Does that describeyou_? _ If you are interested, consider investing in the unique Lesson-2 guidebook _[Satisfactions](http://sfhelp.org/books/toc_satisfactions.htm "table of contents and mail-order link") _(Xlibris.com, 2010, 2nd ed.), It integrates most of the materials in this online Lesson, and provides a convenient portable reference.

**This self-improvement Lesson has three parts:**

* basic concepts
    
* seven powerful communication skills, and...
    
* useful communication applications, tools, and resources.
    

Study these parts when you're not distracted and your true Self is [guiding](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/Selftraits.htm)you. (Lesson 1). Follow the numbered "assignments" order - they build on each other. Option \- check off each step as you complete it to track your progress. Many of these articles include brief introductory YouTube videos .

Part 1)  Learn Communication Basics

__**  2-1)**  Assess your current communication knowledge with this [quiz](http://sfhelp.org/cx/quiz2.htm). Then learn about...

__**  2-2)**  Surface and primary [needs](http://sfhelp.org/relate/keys/needs.htm)**. **Theypowerall human behavior, including communicating.  

__**  2-3)  Review these communication [basics](http://sfhelp.org/cx/basics.htm)** \- What is _communication_? _Effective_ communication? Five reasons we communicate, three "channels" we use, and four simultaneous messages we exchange all the time. One is crucial, yet few people are aware of it. Can you name it?

__  **2-4)**  Study these [Q&A](http://sfhelp.org/cx/qa.htm) items about effective communication.

Part 2)  Learn Seven Communication Skills

**These skills are **based on the concepts above. They build on each other and are just as effective among your dynamic [personality subselves](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/personality.htm)as with adults and kids.

> Process awareness \- notice what's happening inside you, inside your partner, between you, and around you - moment by moment, and over time_._
> 
> Effectivethinking. Popular alternatives are fuzzy, unfocused thinking and/orreacting"without thinking". Typical people (like you?) are unaware of _how_ they think.
> 
> "Digging down" below surface needs to identify the primary needs that cause them.
> 
> Metatalk \- use awareness and a special vocabulary to identify and discuss communication needs and problems_._
> 
> Empathic listening \- "hearing with your _heart_." This skill is also called _mirroring_ and _active listening_.
> 
> Assertion \- saying what you think, feel, and need so your partner can _hear_ you clearly; and...
> 
> Win-win problem-solving (conflict resolution) - filling all partners' current primary needs well enough, in a way that satisfies everyone.
