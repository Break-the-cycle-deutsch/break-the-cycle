# Lesson 04
**Objective** \- studying Lessons 1-4 will empower you to assess the quality of any relationship so you can reduce any stress and raise your satisfaction from it. The concepts in this lesson apply equally to the dynamics among your personality subselves and the people in your life. 

This brief YouTube video outlines the main topics in this Lesson. The video mentions eight lessons in this self-improvement Web site -  I've reduced that to seven.

This fourth self-improvement lesson proposes options for optimizing your relationships. The lesson assumes you've made significant progress on [Lessons 1 thru 3.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)You can assess your knowledge of these lessons by taking these [quizzes.](http://sfhelp.org/site/pop/quizzes.htm)If you feel knowledgeable enough, you can skip some or most of the "review" items in these parts.

Lesson 4 is divided into sequential parts:

1) relationship basics

2) relating to yourself,

3) how to solve relationship problems

4) primary relationships, divorce, and ex-mate relations; and...

5) relating to a Higher Power.

Lesson 5 in this online course focuses on _family_ relationships, and Lesson 6  focuses on parenting children and teens. Lesson 7 focuses on stepfamily relationships.

# **Why Study This Lesson?**

Overall, do your current relationships enhance or degrade the quality of your life? Would you like to improve the quality of your relationships if you could?

We humans are social animals. Adults, kids, and infants need other people to help fill a range of _needs_ like companionship, affirmation, love, support, learning, stimulation, and belonging. Many factors determine our relationship satisfactions, and our society doesn't teach people how to understand and manage these factors well. The evidence is everywhere - divorces, domestic violence, abuse, neglect, abandonment, "not speaking," affairs, crime, and so on. 

Premise - any time the existence and/or actions of person "A" has a "significant effect" on person "B," they have a "relationship." Using this definition, how many relationships do you have now? Among them, identify the most satisfying relationship you have. Now think of one or more stressful relationships. What makes the difference? This lesson offers a practical answer.

You can only control your half of any relationship. Do you know how to optimize your half now? Do you know how to identify "relationship problems" and negotiate effective solutions? Can you choose "compatible" people to relate to, and avoid "problem people?" Did the adults who raised you know these things? Are you teaching the young people in your life how to do them? 

The main reason to study this lesson is to raise your **awareness** of the relationships that shape the quality of your life and your opinion of yourself. Another reason is to grow your ability to analyze and resolve "relationship problems" effectively. On a scale of one (very ineffective) to ten (very effective), how would you rate your abilities to do these two things now?

A third compelling reason to study this lesson is to help you evolve a high-nurturance family (Lesson 5), and improve the lives of a multi-generational fan of living and unborn people that you are affecting.

**Status Check** \- mentally Review the top five of your current life priorities. Is progress with Lessons 1-3 (reducing wounds / learning communication skills / doing good grief) included? With your priorities in mind, rank how important improving your relationship skills and satisfactions is now:

_ very important  _ moderately important  _ unimportant.

If you have limited time and patience, and/or you're a visual/auditory learner, get a preliminary understanding of this lesson by viewing all the videos in YouTube playlists [4a](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL371880BCF97B98A3&feature=mh_lolz) (relationship basics) and [4b](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL165923834F5E11D6&feature=mh_lolz).(marriage and divorce). They total about 15 hours. Most of the articles below include one or more of these videos.

You'll get the most from investing time in this self-improvement Lesson if your true Self [guides you](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/Selftraits.htm)and you choose an undistracted time and place to learn. You can enhance your learning by finding a like-minded partner or group to discuss these learnings with.

# **Lesson 4. Part 1 - Relationship Basics**

# **Lesson 4, Part 2 - Relating to Your Self**

Do you treat yourself as well as you treat people you care the most about? My clinical observation over 30 years is that most Americans treat themselves poorly - i.e. unhealthy diets, too little exercise and quality sleep, too little preventive health care, and choosing unbalanced, stressful  lifestyles.

I propose this is largely due to the pervasive \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)that is relentlessly degrading our society. The purpose of this part is to increase your awareness of how you treat yourself, and to motivate you to improve that.

18.  **Review this perspective on your unique [personality](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/personality.htm) (Lesson 1)

19.  **Review this [comparison](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/compare.htm) of true Self and false-self behavioral traits. Does your Self (capital "S") guide you in most calm and stressful situations? If not, keep working on [Lesson 1!](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/lesson1.htm)

31.  Review these ideas about the skill of [assertion](http://sfhelp.org/cx/skills/assert.htm) (Lesson 2). Then rank yourself as an asserter from one (ineffective) to ten (very effective).

# **Lesson 4, Part 3 - Solve Relationship Problems**

Premise \- a "relationship problem" occurs whenever the attitudes, values, and/or behavior of one person significantly hinders another other person from filling some primary needs. Our society doesn't teach people how to avoid or resolve relationship problems effectively. That's why these steps exist:

54)  **Identify several "significant' relationship problems in your life now, apply what you learned in this part, and see what happens. Option \- journal about your experiences.

# **Lesson 4, Part 4 - Primary Relationships, Divorce, and Ex mates**

Current and former primary relationships have some unique features. This part focuses on optimizing such relationships. Option \- see the related YouTube videos in playlist [4b](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL165923834F5E11D6&feature=mh_lolz) in the "Gerlach" channel. Here "marriage" means a committed primary relationship.

55)**  Review these [four factors](http://sfhelp.org/relate/keys/requisites.htm) required for mutually-satisfying relationships

60)** Compare these ideas about marital [love](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/love.htm) problems with your experience

61)**  Mull these courtship danger signs for [childless](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/danger.htm) and [stepfamily](http://sfhelp.org/sf/date/danger.htm)couples. Divorce begins with unwise courtship choices.

63)**  Compare this opinion about healthy marital [priorities](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/priority.htm) with yours. If you and/or your partner feel you have "too little time" to nourish your relationship, discuss [this](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/no_time.htm).

64)  **Reviewthis timeless [research on couples' communication](http://sfhelp.org/cx/karate.htm)

69)**  each of you mates fill out this strengths/stressors [profile](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/strengths.htm)and discuss it honestly together

70)  **Consider these 16 [alternatives to divorce](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/options.htm),.

My experience as a family-systems therapist for 36 years is that marital trouble and divorce are caused by...

* mates' psychological [wounds](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/wounds.htm)\+ ignorance of grieving, communication, and relationship basics (Lessons 1-4 here) and...
    
* public denial of, and tolerance for, the lethal \[wounds and ignorance\] [cycle.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)
    

If this is so and you experience "marital problems," then avoid counselors, therapists, and marital programs who aren't aware of these causal factors or minimize them. Such well-meaning helpers usually focus on superficial issues, not the [primal ones](http://sfhelp.org/relate/pop/barriers.htm)\- specially not on psychological wounds.)

# **Lesson 4, Part 5 - Relationship with a Higher Power**

Many psychological wound-reduction experts propose that a firm belief in a benign (vs. stern, jealous, wrathful, punitive) Higher Power is essential for progress. [Grown Wounded Children](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/gwc.htm)(GWCs) are either...

* indifferent to spirituality,
    
* atheists or agnostics,
    
* passive believers in a Supreme Being, or...
    
* active believers who pray and worship regularly. They may have a fear-based faith (e.g. fearing sin, God's "wrath," and eternal damnation) or a nourishing faith in a benign, loving, responsive God. 
    

Some of the latter have a one-way relationship. They do not expect to converse with God. Others are open to a two-way (mutual, interactive) relationship with their Higher Power - i.e. having meaningful real-time dialogs. Premises \- a two-way spiritual relationship is achievable by anyone who intentionally increases their [awareness](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/exercise.htm)and seeks to be guided by their true Self.

This is a complex topic which deserves its own Web site. The "assignments" below are offered to increase your awareness and enhance your relationship with a reliable, caring Supreme Being.

71.  **Define the difference between _religion _and_ spirituality_ out loud.Are you religious, spiritual, both, or neither?

72.  With your Self (capital 'S') [in charge,](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/Selftraits.htm)read this perspective on toxic and nurturing [religion](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/religion.htm) (vs.spirituality).

73.  Meditate and reflect: which childhood people - specifically - most influenced your religious faith and practices? Why?

74.  Reflect: were those people following someone else's idea of God, or had they formed their own opinions from reflections and mature experience? 

75.  Do you feel you were encouraged to explore and form your own understanding and ways of worship, or were you required to accept someone else's ways?

76.  Define _ "prayer," _ "effective prayer," and _ "answered prayer" out loud.

77.  **if you pray, do you listen for a response (thoughts, feelings, hunches, and/or "senses")? If not,  why? If so, do you trust and follow your "still, small voice"? If not, why?

78.  Review these proposed [12 steps for Grown Wounded Children](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/12steps.htm) in recovery. Are you motivated to _ adapt these steps to fit you, and _ live by them?

79. Do you depend on some Holy Scripture and church official to interpret God's guidance, or do you trust your own communion with your Higher Power?

80.  Do you think there are truly "evil" people, or are they highly wounded, unaware **[survivors](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/gwc.htm)**of childhood trauma and parental ignorance?

81.  Options \- study "[Conversations With God](http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1571740481/stepfamilyinfo "Amazon.com listing")" by Neale Walsh, and/or [When God Becomes a Drug](http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962328294/stepfamilyinform), by Fr. Leo Booth.

\+ \+ +

82. _Congratulations_ \- you've finished Lesson 4! Take this [quiz](http://sfhelp.org/relate/quiz4.htm) again to assess what you've learned here. Then (a) keep working on Lessons 1-3, and (b) move on to [Lesson 5](http://sfhelp.org/fam/guide5.htm) \- improve your family's functioning.

Options \- re-study and discuss selected topics here in important relationship conflicts and/or on anniversaries. Consider alerting other family members and friends to this ad-free online [course.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)
