# Why Study This Lesson?

From 36 years' professional study and research, this self-study lesson will help you answer these questions:

**Was** I significantly traumatized as a young child? If so, how?
**Am I** psychologically wounded and carrying significant inner pain? If so, what does that mean?
**Who** are the talented subselves that determine my personality?
**Who's running my life - my** true Self, or "someone else"?
**How can I** reduce my wounds and live a more satisfying, productive life?
**Am I** in danger if passing on psychological wounds to my kids? If so, how can I protect them?
**How** can I spot other wounded people and relate to them?
**How** can I judge the functionality .healthy > toxic) of any group, like my family, workplace, and church?
**How** can I help others break the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] cycle?

_Notice what you're thinking and feeling now_

## Background

At least 90% of the 1,000+ typical American adults I've met as a family-systems therapist and educator have shown clear symptoms of up to six psychological wounds from early-childhood abandonment, neglect, and abuse .trauma):

1. a fragmented personality and a disabled true Self. This causes:
2. excessive shame ."low self esteem") and excessive guilts;
3. excessive anxieties and fears of failure, criticism, rejection, abandonment, intimacy, loss of control. and of the unknown;
4. difficulties with self-trust and interpersonal trust;
5. significant reality distortions like chronic denial, minimizing, idealizing, catastrophizing, projecting, intellectualizing, and numbing;

Combinations of these wounds can cause...

6. difficulty feeling. bonding, empathizing, and loving.

Typical wounded people also appeared to be largely unaware of these vital topics:  
 

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| personalities | effective communication | healthy grief |
| relationships | family health | effective parenting |

The unseen combination of psychological wounds and unawareness promotes most personal, family, and social problems. Hundreds of comments on my Break the Cycle! . videos and FaceBook group from over 40 countries around the world suggest that inherited \[wounds + unawareness\] are global stressors, not just American or Western.

## So What?

**Until recognized and reduced**, psychological wounds + unawareness...

* relentlessly degrade [wholistic health,](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/wholistic.htm)relationships, healthy mourning, and effective communication and parenting - i.e. they significantly lower the [nurturance level](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/nurture.htm) .functionality) of most relationships, families, and organizations, and they _amplify_ inner pain.
    
And unrecognized wounds + unawareness...

* promote widespread [inner pain](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/pain.htm)and addictions, obesity, homelessness, crime, depression, abortions, divorce, isolation, "mental illness," dropouts, gangs, fanaticism, bankruptcies, hopelessness, crime, suicide, and other major personal and social problems.
    

In my professional opinion, these six wounds cause most or all .?) non-biological "mental health" problems, like personality and mood disorders, PTSD, paranoias, neuroses, delusions,; dissociation, impulse-control problems, hysteria, "panic attacks," depression, obsessions, compulsions, and so on,

One implication is that most traditional mental-health diagnoses and treatments .including psychotropic medications) are superficial and misleading. They focus on reducing the symptoms, not the underlying wounds. [Internal Family Systems .IFS) therapy](http://selfleadership.org/ "home page selfleadership.org") .Part 3 in this lesson) coupled with education like this ad-free online [course](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)seems to provide permanent wound reduction for most childhood-trauma survivors. 

This Web site calls adult survivors of childhood trauma **[Grown Wounded Children](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/gwc.htm.or GWCs. Lay literature calls us _Adult Children_ .of toxic parents or family [dysfunction).](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/dysfunction.htm) If your reaction is "Well _I'M_ not a GWC!" note that _denial_ .reality distortion) is a common psychological wound.

To see whether you're a GWC, get undistracted and review [this](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/1_traits.htm) and [this](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/compare.htm). Double-check your responses with trusted adults who know you well. If you feel you're not significantly wounded, this lesson can still be useful - specially if you care for young people.

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/lttl-i.gif) The [guidebook](http://sfhelp.org/books/toc_wrryl.htm "Table of contents and ordering llink") for Lesson 1 is "[Who's_ Really_ Running Your Life?](http://sfhelp.org/books/toc_wrryl.htm "table of contents and mail-ordsering link")Free Your true Self and Guard Your Kids" .4th edition, Xlibris.com, 2011). It provides most of the same information as these Web pages, and is available in print and e-book formats. It provides portability for Lesson 1 ideas when online access isn't feasible. The guidebook is not required to do Lesson 1.If_ you have an earlier edition of this .4th edition) book, see this [note.](http://sfhelp.org/books/wrryl_errpop.htm)_

**NOTE** - If you follow underlined links in any Lesson-1 page, __disregard__ the blue box and links at the top of the new page that says "This article assumes you have read..." That paragraph is for people entering the Web site who are not following the lesson guides in order. Also, some lesson-1 pages will refer you to pages in later lessons as a preview. Don't follow any inks in such pages to stay focused on this lesson. 

# Before You Start this Lesson

Inherited psychological wounds and dysfunctional .wound-promoting) environments cause **chronic inner pain**: guilt + shame + fears + emptiness + loneliness + hopelessness. A common unconscious human reflex to distract from this pain is _addiction._

Addictionsto mind-altering chemicals like ethyl alcohol and nicotine distort  perceptions and hinder healthy thinking. If you compulsively use chemicals - including prescribed medications - to manage or reduce inner pain, that will probably slow or block your benefitting from this lesson. 

**To see if you're overusing or addicted to some mind-altering chemical/s including food,** search the Web on "symptoms of alcoholism / substance abuse / chemical dependence." Here's a [sample](http://www.phoenixhouse.org/prevention/signs-and-symptoms-of-substance-abuse/?mm_campaign=84E818376C647EC3848A27AFAF25C5FE&keyword=symptoms%20of%20substance%20abuse&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=Signs_and_Symptoms&gclid=CKnbrIXj3sACFRaSfgod "Phoenix House addiction-sumptom info") of what you'll find. Note that the common wounds of shame and reality distortion promote minimizing and denial ."I wasn't traumatized as a child / am not wounded / have no inner pain / am not addicted.")

If you may be or are addicted to a chemical ,you can

1. get and stay sober for at least a year before working to reduce GWC wounds; or...
2. achieve some progress at addiction recovery and then start healing your wounds .inner pain); or you can...
3. use the wound-reduction strategy in Part 3 of this lesson to help you get and stay sober as you heal.

Trust your own wisdom to make the best choice. Note that "recovery" can mean "achieve sobriety from an addiction" or "reduce inherited psychological wounds."

What follows is the step-by-step assignment guide to this lesson. It is the basis for the other six lessons in this Web site. Expect this lesson to take several weeks or months to complete. For full benefit, I  suggest you do NOT skip around among these assignments. They build on each other.

# LESSON-1 STEPS

There are 52 "assignments" .quizzes, articles, reprints, and worksheets) comprising Lesson 1. Take your time, and study them in order. View this as a high-return long-term investment of your time and energy.

**Option** - keep a log or journal of your experience as you do these assignments. Also consider finding one or more study partners and do this Lesson together.

      If you're an auditory or visual learner, get the essence of Lesson 1 by viewing  the **. videos** on [psychological wounds](http://www...com/playlist?list=PLFDDB7B5952B93B5B "A . video Lesson-1 playlist") and working with your [personality subselves .](http://www...com/playlist?list=PLADB4746B76EEAF47 "a . video playlst")"parts work"). They take about 10 hours to view. Many articles in Lesson 1 begin with one of these brief videos. You can also listen to this 1'20" . interview focused on wounds, recovery, and .: [<ins>https://www...com/watch?v=461QHiHA6pI</ins>](https://www...com/watch?v=461QHiHA6pI)

**Pause** and notice what you're .subselve2s are) thinking and feeling now. Consider journaling about them. When your refreshed and undistracted, put your new foundation knowledge to work:

## Lesson 1, Part 2 - Assess Yourself and Your Family for Wounds

Premise - [Low-nurturance families](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/nurture.htm)and psychological [wounds](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/wounds.htm)are widespread in most .all?) cultures. The wounds range from mild to severe. Most Grown Wounded Children .GWCs) are unaware of their wounds because of denial and social ignorance .lack of knowledge). Implication - _you_ and people you care about may be living with [disabled true Selves](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/false_self.htm)_and enduring preventable stress __without knowing it._

26.  Follow these guidelines on [wound-assessment](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/assess.htm).
27.  If you have questions about wounds or wound-assessment, check this [Q&A](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/wounds/qa.htm) or [ask me](http://sfhelp.org/site/responseform.htm).

If you feel you do have significant psychological wounds, continue with Part 3 below. If you're not sure, ask someone you trust to be objective .like a counselor) to review this [summary](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/compare.htm) and give you an opinion on who's running your life. If you feel your wounds aren't significant .by your standards), skip to [Part 4](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/guide1.htm#4%20other%20gwcs). Even if you're minimally wounded, you can still benefit from Lessons [2 thru 6 or 7](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm)in this self-improvement Web site.

**Now you're ready to learn how to use "parts work**" to reduce your wounds and free your true Self to guide you. Do you need a break now?

## Lesson 1, Part 3 - _**_**Free Your true Self and Reduce Your Wounds

One key to protecting your family and descendents from major stress is to admit and reduce significant psychological wounds. The other key is to convert [unawareness](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/aware.htm)and ignorance into knowledge. That's why this self-improvement course exists. If you feel you're significantly wounded .controlled by false selves), this part of lesson 1 will guide you through an effective personal wound-reduction ."recovery") process.

Option \- if you want an overview of this part, view all 15 videos in the [Lesson-1 . **playlist**](http://www...com/playlist?list=PLADB4746B76EEAF47&feature=view_all) 1c in order .about 3 hours). If you commit to personal wound-reduction, I recommend you do all the Part-3 "assignments" below in order. Many of the assignments include one or more of the videos.

29.  Study this 3-page overview of how to [reduce psychological wounds](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/recover.htm).

30.  Experience this [video](http://youtu.be/a3PC8E8qC6o "A . clip by the author") on what to expect as you reduce your wounds;

31.  **Study this perspective on hitting "[true bottom](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/bottom.htm)." If you haven't clearly hit yours, view these steps as a valuable learning experience .a trial recovery), and go ahead.

32.  **Read this 8-page [guide](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/IF/ifs.htm) to "parts work" ._inner _family therapy). This is one effective way to reduce your wounds over time. Other clinicians propose different ways to help you recover from toxic parents and childhood trauma.

My experience as a veteran .recovering) therapist is that other recovery methods are apt to be superficial and take longer. Exceptions are [Voice Dialog](http://delos-inc.com/), [Psychosynthesis](http://two.not2.org/psychosynthesis/), and Eye-Movement Desensitization and Retraining .[EMDR](http://www.emdr.com/)). Christians may find [Theophostic Ministries](http://www.theophostic.com/)helpful.

33.  Consider shopping for a qualified parts-work therapist in your area. See [selfleadership.org](http://www.selfleadership.org/)for leads and helpful resources. I'm a 1992 graduate of their training program.

34.  Meditate on this update of the well-known [12 Steps](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/12steps.htm) and consider creating and living by your version of it.

35.  Decide if you want to tell key people what you're doing, and why. Expect others to not know about subselves and/or to be [skeptical](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/IF/letter.htm) of parts work. If they are, refer them to http://sfhelp.org/fam/cycle.htm without preaching.

If you can find someone else interested in or already doing parts-work, consider teaming up with them. Know that some personality subselves_ pretend _to want to recover, but aren't really committed. They're not "bad," they're scared, and need patient reassurance and encouragement.

36.  Evolve a list of your subselves, and group them as Managers, Inner Kids, and Guardians or Firefighters. Follow the guidelines in [this article](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/IF/ifs.htm)

37)  **Learn more about your [''inner family''](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/inr_f.htm)of subselves by inventorying your personal [human assets](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/assets.htm).

38.  Start with most active subselves who you feel don't know or trust your true Self .capital "S"). [Interview](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/IF/dialog.htm) them one at a time, and .a) confirm their distrust, and .b) start negotiating to build their trust. Use the parts-work steps and techniques outlined [here](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/IF/ifs.htm).\- ideally with the help of a trained inner-family systems .IFS) therapist.

39. Patiently repeat this process with each Inner Child and protective Guardian subself who causes your wounds and troublesome thoughts and behaviors. Keep in mind _there are no "bad" subselves_. They all mean to help, but often retain outdated or distorted information from your early life and unaware caregivers.

40.  Practice asking yourself "Who's [in charge](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/compare.htm) now: my true Self .capital 'S') or someone else? You're "done" with this wound-reduction process when you usually answer "My Self."

41)  **As you progress at these steps, periodically reread this [overview](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/recover.htm) of wound-reduction and/or the Lesson-1 [guidebook](http://sfhelp.org/books/pop_wrryl.htm)"Who's _Really_ Running Your Life?" .4th edition).

42.  Review your options for improving your _ [self-respect, self love](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/selflove.htm), and _ [self confidence](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/confidence.htm). These increase as you free your true Self and reduce the wounds of excessive shame and reality distortion

43. **Review and reflect on this brief . [video](http://youtu.be/UpOosPcS33Y) on understanding and protecting your _integrity._ It's the root of your priceless self respect and healthy pride.

44. **Raise your awareness of the importance of [physical human contact](http://sfhelp.org/relate/touch.htm), and discover whether you're getting enough nourishing touching..

45. **If you have problems with self control, consider these [options](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/control.htm)

46. If you have problems with excessive procrastination, see this brief . [video](http://youtu.be/i2Ml2JWbqCc). If you struggle with "laziness," see [this brief video](http://youtu.be/l4yMz0TAdK4).

47. Review these [titles](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/help/books.htm#wounds+recovery) about "Adult Children" .Grown Wounded Children) to see other viewpoints.

Option \- scan this [link-index](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/links1.htm) of Lesson-1 resources, and .re)read any that now seem relevant to you and your family.  
 

##  Lesson 1, Part 4 - Learn how to spot and relate to wounded people

As you experience wound-reduction benefits, you'll become more aware of others who are wounded and don't realize they're ruled by false selves. Common responses are to pity, judge, and/or rescue them. This is specially true for wounded [mates](http://sfhelp.org/relate/gwc.htm), friends, and respected .and vexing) relatives.

48.  Use this behavioral [comparison](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/compare.htm) to recognize people ruled by false selves. For a more detailed tool, use [this](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/1_traits.htm).

49.  Periodically refresh your understanding of [Grown Wounded Children](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/gwc.htm) .GWCs) and what it [means](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/means.htm) to be a GWC in denial.

50. Tailor theserelationshipoptions to fit your style and situation with wounded [kids](http://sfhelp.org/parent/problem.htm) and [adults](http://sfhelp.org/relate/gwc.htm); and...

51.  Edit and add these [communication options](http://sfhelp.org/cx/options.htm) to fit your situation.

52.  [Tell receptive others](http://sfhelp.org/alert.htm) about the \[wounds + unawareness\] cycle, what you're learning here, and about any benefits you're experiencing from this Lesson.

\+ \+ +

       As you progress with these assignments, notice any shifts in your attitudes, reactions, and behaviors that feel "significant." Be alert for others' comments on such changes. I suggest you also progress at [Lesson 2](http://sfhelp.org/cx/pop/lesson2.htm)\- improve your communication effectiveness. These two Lessons use and amplify each other.

Stay aware that you may "complete" these assignments, but learning from them really has no end. As you gain knowledge and awareness and [free](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/freeSelf.htm)your true Self to guide you, your version of these ideas will become a way of life.
