_7 self-improvement lessons to protect your family_

## Why this Web site exists, what's in it, and how to benefit from It

This ad-free, educational Web site is for people who take their lives seriously - specially those caring for minor kids (or plan to). A quick test to determine if you are such a person - have you identified your life-purpose yet, or are you seriously seeking it? If "not yet," this self-improvement course may be of little use to you now. Either way, invest one minute in the inspirational video ["The Dash"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsY6UrFIsNs) - it's about you and your life.

> **This educational Web site exists to alert you to** a widespread personal and family stressor - [psychological wounds + unawareness] that silently passes down the generations and is weakening most (all?) cultures. This inheritance promotes social problems like abuse, neglect, divorce, crime, abortions, addictions, bigotry, "mental illness," runaways, terrorism, gangs, homelessness, obesity, depression, suicide, bankruptcy, and murder. Have any of these affected your family?

Based on 36 years' clinical experience and study, this nonprofit site offers you a free 7-Lesson self-improvement course on how to understand and break this lethal inheritance and reduce major personal, marital, and family problems. Average adults are unaware of this cycle and its toxic effects. Are you aware of them?

## What Does "Break the Cycle" Mean?

The "cycle" is this: psychologically-wounded, unaware parents raise wounded, unaware kids. They grow up, choose wounded, unaware partners, and raise wounded, unaware kids - who repeat and spread the cycle and its effects in their society. For more detail, read this after you finish here.

**To break this cycle,** adults like you must want to...

- learn about and accept the cycle, starting with their own family tree;
- assess, admit, and reduce their psychological wounds;
- learn the basics in this online course - alone or with other people;
- choose a wholistically-healthy, informed partner; and you must want to...
- patiently evolve a high-nurturance family together over many years, despite many obstacles, in order to raise "Grown Nurtured Children" (GNCs). GNCs...
  - are steadily guided by their true Selves in all situations; and...
  - know how to communicate and grieve effectively; and how to make healthy relationship, conception, and parenting choices, and...
  - are apt to discover and pursue a useful life purpose.

In my experience as a professional family-systems therapist since 1981 - average adults have inherited the cycle and it's effects, and are unconsciously passing them on. They (you?) are **Grown Wounded Children** (GWCs) - and they don't (want to) know that or what it means

> From the international feedback to the 180 YouTube videos augmenting this Web site, it seems that adults in most or all other cultures inherit and pass on this lethal cycle also.

To see if inherited psychological wounds + unawareness are harming you and your family members, read this summary article and return here. If they are harming your family - who should stop that?

## Suggestions on Using this Self-study Course

- **Make** freeing your true Self (Lesson 1) your highest ongoing priority. That will maximize your return for investing time and energy in this unique self-improvement course. Consider joining the free, private FaceBook group of other Lesson-1 students from around the world..
- **Keep** a long-range perspective (e.g. the rest of your life) and the open mind of a student. Many ideas here will differ from what you've been taught. Experiment with them, rather than pre-judging.
- **Do not** expect these ideas and tools to resolve any crises immediately - take your time!.
- **Avoid** using these ideas as absolutes. Sense the themes underlying them, and adapt them to fit your unique personality, style, experience, and circumstances.
- **Keep** these ageless guidelines in mind as you grow and heal.
- **To** benefit from this self-improvement course...

  - **complete** each lesson at your own pace. The 7 lessons build on each other, so study them in order. Treat this learning as you would a sequence of college courses. The more you learn, the more all topics will make integrated sense to you.
