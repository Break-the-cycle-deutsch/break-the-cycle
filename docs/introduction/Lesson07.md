# Lesson 07
**This is one of a series of lesson-7 articles **on howtoevolve a [high-nurturance](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/nurture.htm)stepfamily. The "_/_" in re_/_marriage and re_/_divorce here notes that it may be a stepparent's first union. "Co-parents" means both bioparents, or any of the several related stepparents and bioparents co-managing a multi-home [nuclear stepfamily.](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/nuc_sf.htm)

  This brief YouTube clip previews Lesson 7. The video says there are eight lessons in this Web site: I've reduced that to seven.

If you're in a stepfamily, please help improve lesson 7  
by taking this brief anonymous **<ins>survey</ins>**.

  **This study guide **assumes you're familiar withthe (a) [intro](http://sfhelp.org/site/intro.htm) to this nonprofit Website, (b) the [premises](http://sfhelp.org/site/premises.htm) underlying it, and (c) online self-improvement Lessons [1 thru 6](http://sfhelp.org/pop/course.htm) ,

  A major cause of stepfamily stress and divorce is adult unawareness and ignorance of stepfamily norms and realities. A high percentage of current stepfamily information and programs are anecdotal and superficial.

**![](http://sfhelp.org/art/lttl-i.gif)****  LESSON 7 - evolve a high-nurturance stepfamily**

Families exist to _nurture _\- i.e. to fill their members' [basic needs.](http://sfhelp.org/relate/pop/maslow.htm)  Depending on many factors, families (like yours) range from low-nurturance to high-nurturance. Typical [divorcing](http://sfhelp.org/relate/pop/divorcing.htm)families and stepfamilies are at special risk of passing on the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)and being vulnerable to these [hazards.](http://sfhelp.org/pop/hazards.htm)

This lesson uses the ideas in lessons 1-6 to propose how to form and keep a flourishing re/marriage and an enduring, high-nurturance [stepfamily.](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/full_sf.htm)

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/starbullet.gif)  **Objectives** \- Lesson 7 will empower you to...

* understand the many differences between complex stepfamilies and intact biofamilies,
    
* make wise stepfamily courtship decisions,
    
* form realistic stepfamily expectations,
    
* identify and resolve many role and relationship problems, and...
    
* achieve a stable, high-nurturance stepfamily over some years.
    

This Lesson is best begun in courtship. It has four parts

> **1)  **Learn stepfamily basics
> 
> **2)** How to make wise courtship commitment decisions;
> 
> **3)  **Effective co-parenting basics (stepparenting and bioparenting), and...
> 
> **4)  **How to avoid and **s**olve common stepfamily role and relationship problems,

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/lttl-i.gif) Options 

> **check off** each assignment after you complete it to track your progress. Expect to take at least 6-8 weeks to fully understand, discuss, and integrate the concepts in Lesson 7.
> 
> **keep** a [journal or log](http://sfhelp.org/pop/journal.htm)as you study these assignments to track you reactions and awarenesses. Your log can provide a source of rich perspective in the future.
> 
> **If you're not** already in a stepfamily, think of one you know and keep them in mind as you study. Ask the adults to comment on what you learn here.
> 
> **Study** these assignments with a partner or support group that shares your interest in learning.

Pause and reflect - how do you fee about all that you learned in this Part-1 overview of stepfamily basics? How many typical single parents and new-stepfamily adults would know what you now know?

**Lesson 7, Part 2 - Essential Courtship Tasks**

  A stepfamily begins when a single parent starts to date a potential new partner seriously. My clinical and personal experience is that typical needy stepfamily couples make impulsive, uninformed courtship choices, and later regret them.

Part 2 uses Lessons 1-6 and Part 1 to help courting partners choose the right people to commit to, for the right reasons, at the right time. These articles can still be very useful _after_ committing.

__ **7-17)  **Retake this[quiz](http://sfhelp.org/relate/quiz4.htm) on healthy-relationship basics, and re-study [Lesson-4 topics](http://sfhelp.org/relate/guide4.htm) as needed.

__ **7-23)  **Study and _heed_ these 16 common stepfamily-courtship [danger signs](http://sfhelp.org/sf/date/danger.htm)

__ **7-24)**  Poll your stepfamily adults to see who fully accepts (a) your [identity](http://sfhelp.org/sf/id.htm) as a multi-home stepfamily, and (b) what that [means](http://sfhelp.org/sf/means.htm). If you discover significant unawareness, ambivalence, or disputes, yellow light!

__ **7-25)**  Seek agreement among your stepfamily adults on who [belongs](http://sfhelp.org/sf/members.htm) to your stepfamily now. If you discover significant ambivalence or disputes, yellow light!

__ **7-26)  **Learn the 16 things new stepfamilies need to [merge,](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/merge16.htm)and how to master related [stressors](http://sfhelp.org/relate/stressors.htm).

__ **7-27)**  Invest in reading and discussing the unique guidebook [Stepfamily Courtship](http://sfhelp.org/books/toc_courtship.htm), (Xlibris, 2002). It integrates all the key idea in this Web site. 

__ **7-28)  **Each of you partners thoughtfully fill out these worksheets alone, when you're undistracted and your true Self is [guiding](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/Selftraits.htm)you:

* Am I committing for the [right reasons?](http://sfhelp.org/sf/date/reasons.htm)
    
* Is this the [right time](http://sfhelp.org/sf/date/time.htm) for us to commit?
    

Take your time with these worksheets, and pay attention to your [thoughts and feelings.](http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/selftalk.htm) They're as instructive as your answers.

__ **7-29)**  When you're both done, discuss your findings together _honestly. _If you each feel confident you're choosing the right people to commit to, for the right reasons, at the right time - celebrate and set the date!

__** 7-30)  **Review and discuss these brief [research summaries](http://sfhelp.org/site/research.htm#L4%20-%20relate/marriage) about primary relationships.

__** 7-31)  **Use this [framework](http://sfhelp.org/sf/date/wedding.htm) to help plan your stepfamily commitment ceremony and honeymoon. They're usually much more complicated than traditional rites!

Recall: "co-parent" mean any one of the adults providing significant care for minor stepfamily kids. Part 3 has two sections: (a) effective co-parenting basics, and (b) special co-parenting issues.

**Lesson 7, Part 3a - ****Effective Stepfamily Co-parenting Basics**

  Effective childcare is much more complex in multi-home stepfamilies than in typical intact biofamilies. There are more kids, more co-parents, more relatives, more role confusion, fewer social norms, and more concurrent adjustment tasks to master together. Most new-stepfamily co-parents (and all kids) are unaware of these complexities, and don't know how to balance and master them.

  Based on 36 years' professional research, Part 3 offers clear, practical in formation on  effective ways of managing these stressors _IF_ family adults have committed to make significant progress on Lessons 1-6 and Parts 1 and 2 above.  

  Take your time, and do these assignments in order. Ideally, all the adults in your stepfamily and any professional supporter will do these together. _Do NOT work on this Part without completing Lessons 1-6 and Parts 1 and 2 above!  Also, do NOT expect these Parts to provide a quick answer to __any stepfamily [crisis!](http://sfhelp.org/pop/crisis.htm)_

I encourage you to read through all these items before starting to do them \- get the big picture! Keep a long-range view, and consider journaling your thoughts and feelings as you do these steps.

A thoro statement will refer to or include a practical [family grieving policy](http://sfhelp.org/grief/policy.htm) (Lesson 3).

__** 7-34)  **Review these answers to common questions about _ [stepkids](http://sfhelp.org/sf/co/qa_sc.htm), _ [stepsiblings](http://sfhelp.org/sf/co/qa.htm), and _ [<ins>co-parenting</ins>](http://sfhelp.org/parent/qa.htm), and _ [ex mates](http://sfhelp.org/relate/mates/ex.htm).

**Lesson 7, Part 4 - ****Solve Stepfamily Role  
 and Relationship Problems**

  Every evolving family has conflicts over member roles (responsibilities) and relationships. These conflicts are more complex and more frequent in typical stepfamilies because they have more members, [relationships,](http://sfhelp.org/fam/pop/formula.htm)[roles,](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/roles.htm)and [stressors,](http://sfhelp.org/sf/pop/primary_11.htm)and fewer social norms to guide them.

\+ \+ +

  If you've patiently studied Lessons 1-7, I congratulate you! You now know more about personalities, relationships, communication, grieving, families, parenting, and stepfamilies than most laypeople _and family professionals_. Does the claim "most family adults don't know what they don't know" make more sense to you now?

 

  **Do you better understand** my claim that...

* there is little _informed_ stepfamily support available in communities and the media?
    
* many stepfamily adults and most kids feel confused and overwhelmed at times?
    
* many re/marrying co-parents make _uninformed_ (unwise) commitment choices?
    
* most printed and online stepfamily information is superficial? And that...
    
* the lethal \[wounds + unawareness\] [cycle](http://sfhelp.org/pop/cycle.htm)is spreading silently throughout our culture?
    

![](http://sfhelp.org/art/colorbutton.gif) **Recap**

This seventh self-improvement lesson uses Lessons 1-6 to help adults (a) create and maintain a high-nurturance stepfamily, (b) break the \[wounds + unawareness\] cycle, and (c) avoid re/divorce. The lesson breaks this complex subject into four sequential parts: learn...

* Stepfamily basics,
    
* Essential courtship tasks,
    
* Effective co-parenting basics (stepparenting and bioparenting), and learn how to...
    
* Solve common stepfamily role and relationship problems,
    

  The ideas in this lesson are based on 36 years' professional research on stepfamily dynamics, and personal experience as a stepson, stepfather, stepbrother, and step-grandson.
