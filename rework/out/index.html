          Pete Gerlach graduated from Stanford University with a degree in
          engineering. He lived in the Chicago area for most of his adult life.
          Several years of his career were spent in engineering and business. He
          later recognized that his true interest was in helping people with low
          nurturance childhoods like his own, heal and attain a healthy sense of
          self and wholeness. He earned his Masters in Social Work, and
          continued to take classes, to study inner family systems with Dick
          Schwartz and develop his own expertise in Personality Parts Work as
          well as remarriage and blended families.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
          Pete co-founded the nonprofit Stepfamily Association of Illinois, Inc.
          (SAI) with interested others in 1981. Shortly after that, he was
          invited to join the Board of Directors of the Stepfamily Association
          of America (SAA) by its founders, Drs. John and Emily Visher. He later
          served on the SAA Advisory Council, and was invited to rejoin the
          Board in March 2002 by President Marjorie Engel, PhD. After SAA passed
          its mission to the National Stepfamily Resource Center (NSRC), Pete
          became a member of their Stepfamily Experts Council. Pete took over
          3,000 calls on the Stepfamily inFormation "warm-line." He moderated
          the "Stepfamily Issues" chat at Divorcenet.com for two years, and
          answered over 500 online step-parenting questions at AllExperts.com.
          He rejoined AllExperts.com in 2008 as an expert in effective
          communication, childhood-trauma recovery, marriage, and counseling.
